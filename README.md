* This application can be found at https://hoodhunter.herokuapp.com/

* This application is used to search for potential neighborhoods.  Users can input any city, address, or landmark, choose from an array of desired local amenities, and a Google Map will be generated.

* The map will show markers and a listing for the location of all of the amenities in the area.  Users can click on each to find more information about them and a link to that location's Google page.

* The site also features a social page where registered users can participate in discussions about neighborhoods or post their own questions.
